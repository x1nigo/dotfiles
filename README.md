# Unseen Village
These are my personal dotfiles, which include scripts to my other repositories.

## Some programs that I use in my dotfiles:
- `nvim` - text editor
- `zsh` - shell
- `lf` - file manager
- `sxiv` - image viewer
- `zathura` - pdf viewer
- `mpv` - video/audio player

If you don't want to use `neovim` and just want the regular `vim`, you can
just copy <u>init.vim</u> from `.config/nvim` and replace it with either
`~/.vimrc` or `~/.vim/vimrc`.

## NOTE
My dotfiles are meant to work together with my other repositories, namely the
suckless software ones.
