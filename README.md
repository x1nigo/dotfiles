# The Dotfiles
These are my personal dotfiles, which include scripts to my other repositories.

## Some programs that I use in my dotfiles:
- `nvim` - text editor
- `zsh` - shell
- `lf` - file manager
- `sxiv` - image viewer
- `zathura` - pdf viewer
- `mpv` - video/audio player
- `ncmpcpp` - music player daemon
- `newsboat` - feed reader for text terminals

If you don't want to use `neovim` and just want the regular `vim`, you can
just copy init.vim from `.config/nvim` and replace it with either
`~/.vimrc` or `~/.vim/vimrc`.

## Gtk theme used:
- `Gruvbox-Dark-B` - From [here](https://github.com/Fausto-Korpsvart/Gruvbox-GTK-Theme).

## NOTE
My dotfiles are meant to work together with my other repositories, namely the
suckless software ones:
- [dwm](https://github.com/x1nigo/dwm) &ndash; The window manager
- [st](https://github.com/x1nigo/st) &ndash; The terminal emulator
- [dmenu](https://github.com/x1nigo/dmenu) &ndash; The dynamic menu launcher
- [dwmblocks](https://github.com/x1nigo/dwmblocks) &ndash; The status bar
