# The Dotfiles
These are my personal dotfiles, which include scripts to my other repositories.

## Some programs that I use in my dotfiles:
- `nvim` - text editor
- `bash` - shell
- `sf` - file manager
- `sxiv` - image viewer
- `zathura` - pdf viewer
- `mpv` - video/audio player
- `ncmpcpp` - music player daemon
- `newsboat` - feed reader for text terminals
- `pipewire` - volume/mic audio program

## NOTE
My dotfiles are meant to work together with my other repositories, namely the
suckless software ones:
- [dwm](https://github.com/x1nigo/dwm) &ndash; The window manager
- [st](https://github.com/x1nigo/st) &ndash; The terminal emulator
- [dmenu](https://github.com/x1nigo/dmenu) &ndash; The dynamic menu launcher
- [dwmblocks](https://github.com/x1nigo/dwmblocks) &ndash; The status bar
