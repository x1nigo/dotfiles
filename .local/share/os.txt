Welcome to x1nigo's operating system! -> (void linux / OpenBSD + custom scripts)

I. Introduction

This custom setup is created for both Void Linux and
OpenBSD as these are what I use. It is meant to be
as minimal as possible and to get out of your way.

II. Programs

Listed here are most of the programs that I use for
my system (but not all):

- nsxiv (image viewer)
- zathura (pdf viewer)
- mpv (media player)
- sf (custom-made file manager)
- vim/neovim (text editor)
- dwm (window manager)
- st (terminal)
- dmenu (launcher)

III. Keybindings

This is very different from Windows or MacOS as this particular
system prioritizes the use of shortcuts (for speed and
efficiency).

Here are the more important keybindings to take note of:

- super + return (terminal)
- super + w (browser)
- super + backspace (system menu)
- super + q (close window)
- super + d (dmenu)
- super + f1 (read this document)
- super + f12 (refresh window manager)
- super + x (change wallpaper)
- super + insert (shortcuts)

For more keybindings, check out "config.h" under the dwm
folder located in ~/.local/src/dwm.

IV. Conclusion

Minimalism is at the crux of this system but it does not
preclude the user from adding whatever he/she wants. After
all, this is the point of free and open-source software.

Enjoy your stay.
