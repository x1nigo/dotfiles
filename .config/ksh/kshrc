# NAME:
#	ksh.kshrc - global initialization for ksh
#
# DESCRIPTION:
#	Each invocation of /bin/ksh processes the file pointed
#	to by $ENV (usually $HOME/.kshrc).
#	This file is intended as a global .kshrc file for the
#	Korn shell.  A user's $HOME/.kshrc file simply requires
#	the line:
#		. /etc/ksh.kshrc
#	at or near the start to pick up the defaults in this
#	file which can then be overridden as desired.
#
# SEE ALSO:
#	$HOME/.kshrc
